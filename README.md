## Files description 

### `Machine-Learning-project-1`
The goal of the graded project was to obtain a model to detect the presence of the Higg's boson given a CERN-provided dataset. This folder contains a copy of the entire project. See the `README.md` file inside for a detailed description. It contains a link to the final (submitted for grading) repository of the project. Made as part of the CS-433 - Machine Learning course.

#### keywords / concepts implemented : 
*machine learning, linear regression, logistic regression, exploratory data analysis, data pre-processing*
